the ram and hd versions have lots of duplicate code. it would be nice to clean that up a bit, so we don't need to change so many things for the merkle->verkle update.


* rewrite of store.erl . we should update the pedersen commitment at each node, by subtracting the old value and adding the new one. Look for opportunities to simplify the jacobian format of the points. 

* get.erl needs to be re-implemented for a wider path size, and to not include extra info with the proof. Just store an index and the root hash, not the entire list.

* verify.erl should be written to use multi-proofs of ipa. We need a way to calculate the new verkle root from just this proof, assuming we had no other database.

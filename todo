* get leaf and stem modules working with the new format.
- add the pedersen commitment to each stem. update the size of the data stored. 
- update stem hash to be the hash of the commitment.
- update add/5 to change the commitment.


* check that when we hash a leaf or stem, the data is the correct length. don't serialize a bunch of extra zeros unnecessarily.

* make a simple example of a 2-step proof.

* rewrite of store.erl . we should update the pedersen commitment at each node, by subtracting the old value and adding the new one. Look for opportunities to simplify the jacobian format of the points. 

* get.erl needs to be re-implemented for a wider path size, and to not include extra info with the proof. Just store an index and the root hash, not the entire list.

* verify.erl should be written to use multi-proofs of ipa. We need a way to calculate the new verkle root from just this proof, assuming we had no other database.

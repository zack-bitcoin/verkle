matrix_diagonal_flip is _very_ inefficient. We should change the code so this isn't needed.
in both store.erl and secp256k1.erl



it seems like storage has some inefficiency.
compare the new store:precompute_multi_exponent speed vs the bucket method from secp256k1. if it only takes 10/16th the executition time, then it is already efficient. if it is faster than that, then there is some inefficiency to take care of.


maybe stems should store their data as lists, because in store.erl we only access the data in order.

there are a couple todo notes in store.erl

we need to find a way to measure which parts of store are slowing us down.


it gets slow if we do more than 40k in a batch
a todo note in get.erl and in multiprove.


We need a more secure way to generate the 512 base points.
Maybe use the integers [1,2,3...] as entropy to a deterministic generator.

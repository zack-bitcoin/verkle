we can make inner product arguments around 2x faster by using the same pre-compute strategy that we use for storage. Store powers of the base point, so we can skip that step of the bucket strategy.


maybe stems should store their data as lists, because in store.erl we only access the data in order.
This could potentially make storage about 1 second faster.
but it looks like it would make it slower to look up data.

there are a couple todo notes in store.erl


We need a more secure way to generate the 512 base points.
Maybe use the integers [1,2,3...] as entropy to a deterministic generator.
